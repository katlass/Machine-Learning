1. Look at histograms, determine data irregularities.
  a. Tip: if there is geo data plot it w/ lat/long
  b. Consider a clustering algorithm if you notice common independent variables have common dependent variable
2. Correlations: compute standard correlation coefficient. 
  a. Only measures linear correlation
  b. corr_matrix = df.corr() or pandas scatter matrix
    i. if correlatio plots show abnormalities (like lines, considering removing that data to avoid is learning these datat quirks
3. Data Manipulation
  a. If seem tail heavy, try log transform or other
2. Determine if you should use stratified sampling
