1. Look at histograms, determine data irregularities.
  a. Tip: if there is geo data plot it w/ lat/long
  b. Consider a clustering algorithm if you notice common independent variables have common dependent variable
2. Correlations: compute standard correlation coefficient. corr_matrix = df.corr()
2. Determine if you should use stratified sampling
